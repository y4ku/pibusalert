### Summary
This is a raspberry pi version of a repo that was created July 30th, 2016 for International Node Bots Day. We accessed the CTA Bus Api and blink a LED on a Photon if a particular bus is 4 or more minutes away from a particular bus stop. Now we're setting up a webapp + server that will track more than one bus on a visual display.

### Setup
Don't forget to set you .env file with the CTA API Key
